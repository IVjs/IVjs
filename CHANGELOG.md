# {{next-version}}


## v0.2.0

* background audio loops by default, with options to disable and enable looping
* fixed a bug where video "on complete" commands would fire even if we had already gone to another node, though it [doesn't completely mitigate the problem](https://github.com/flixpressllc/IVjs/issues/9).
* added this change log. :wink:
