# IVjs Introduction

IVjs is an advanced JavaScript framework for rapid development of interactive video applications and experiences.   It is mobile-friendly, and allows one to rapidly develop a wide variety of interactive video applications.

IVjs employs the familiar JS method chaining syntax in order to structure nodes that execute various commands at runtime.  

#### IV commands can:

- Manipulate, evaluate and utilize variables
- Playback video files and define onComplete events for these files
- Manage audio playback and volume
- Define and evaluate conditional clauses at runtime
- Run sub-routines
- Manage user input
- Manage branched execution based on various conditions
- Call APIs and utilize the response in order to drive the experience
- And plenty of other functions that are useful for interactive development
